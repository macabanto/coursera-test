            HTML is the structure of the website and CSS makes the website human friendly
        </p>
        <p>
            Hyper Text Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets: Hyper text meaning an abundance of text and Cascading
            meaning passed on to others.

        <p>
            CSS is used as a separate file as it enables the scalability of a website; instead of individually styling
            multiple HTML files inline/internally, doing it externally and applying it to every page means less
            typing/less redundant processes
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider any website with many links; even though the content is different on each page, the style remains
            the same. Keeping this convention makes it easier for the user to understand what is going on without having
            to observe the whole page i.e: keeping navigation, main body, etc in the same area makes it so the user can
            expect where to look.
        </p>
        <p>
            By doing CSS externally and linking it to multiple files, a convention is created and the website feels like
            a cohesive entity rather than multiple linked pages. CONSISTENCY and EFFICIENCY
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to get CSS files linked correctly; a convention should be used within the HTML files so the CSS
            file can be applied to them. This means keeping id names and class names the same.

            a <span class="key_word">CSS Rule</span> consits of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a <span class="key_word">selector</span>(which ELEMENT to be styled) and is followed by {}...</li>
            <li>
                aka the <span class="key_word">declaration</span>. the declaration consists of two parts:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="key_word">property</span></li>
                    <li><span class="key_word">value</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Element properties and their associated possible values can be found on
            <a href="https://www.quackit.com/html/tags/" target="_blank">this website!</a>
            <br>
            the element property and value are always separated by a colon. a ";" indicates the end of a styling
            declaration.
            <br>
            A CSS rule can consist of multiple declarations
            <br>
            Every BROWSER has its own default styles that it applies to different HTML elements all of which can be
            overriden with your own stlyes
